A JOBSEEKER WEBSITE (2ND ANDELA PROJECT)


**********************************************  DESCRIPTION **********************************************************

This project was about creating our own version of a jobseeker website from one that had already been done by someone else


*********************************************   THINGS LEARNT ********************************************************

I learnt how to pay attention to details. I enhanced by css and design skills a step further because this particular website
had more content as compared to the first andela project which didn't have much content. I faced issues with positioning divs,
floating problems and much more.
